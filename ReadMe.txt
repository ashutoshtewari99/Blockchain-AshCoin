To run the file type in terminal: g++ sha256.cpp Blockchain.cpp -o sha256_example && ./sha256_example
In the earlier version of this Blockchain it used the standard hashing library of C++ 
which used to create random ashes of different sizes
But now In this nutrition that uses SHA 256 hashing algorithm which is far more secure 
and exactly 64 characters long.
